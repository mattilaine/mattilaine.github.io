# This is a repository for my personal GitHub pages

Using [Password protection for static pages](https://github.com/matteobrusa/Password-protection-for-static-pages) to add simple password protection for the static page.

**NOTE:**  
The password based protection is not "safe" in this case, especially because the repository is public.  
It's just for trying things out and playing around a bit.

Also, if you are here, you probably know how to pass it ðŸ¤ª
